        <h2>About Valyrian Coders</h2>

        <p className="about-lead">
          Valyrian Coders is a freelance software collective built around
          precision engineering, reliability, and long-term thinking.
        </p>

        <p>
          We approach software as a system, not a collection of features.
          Every decision — from architecture to implementation — is made
          with maintainability, performance, and clarity in mind.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our work favors clean design, predictable delivery, and solutions
          that continue to perform well beyond launch.
